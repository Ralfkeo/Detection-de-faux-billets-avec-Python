## Description
Welcome to the "Detection-de-faux-billets-avec-Python" repository! This project is part of the OpenClassrooms Data Analyst Pro Path - Project 12. Here, we explore the fascinating world of detecting counterfeit currency using Python. We dive into the realm of machine learning and data analysis to build a prediction model that can identify fake banknotes with high accuracy.
